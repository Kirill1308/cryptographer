# Cryptographer Project

## Introduction

The Cryptographer project is a Java-based application that provides a set of cryptographic functionalities (encryption, decryption, hacking).

### **Caesar Cipher Implementation:**

The project currently features a sophisticated implementation of the Caesar cipher, a classic encryption technique. The Caesar cipher allows users to perform encryption, decryption, and exploration of hacking techniques within a user-friendly interface.

### **Extensibility and SOLID Principles:**

The Cryptographer project is built on the SOLID principles, ensuring a modular and extensible architecture. This design philosophy allows for straightforward integration of new types of ciphers. Whether you wish to add modern cryptographic algorithms or experiment with historical ciphers, the project's structure facilitates easy expansion.

### **Design Patterns Integration**

The Cryptographer project strategically incorporates several design patterns to enhance its architecture:

- **Facade Pattern:**
The facade pattern simplifies the complexity of cryptographic operations by providing a unified interface. Users can interact with a simplified, high-level interface while the underlying system seamlessly manages intricate cryptographic processes.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern:**
Leveraging the abstract factory pattern, the project facilitates the creation of families of related commands, ensuring a cohesive and consistent approach to cryptographic components. This pattern enhances flexibility and promotes adherence to SOLID principles.
- **Command Pattern:**
The command pattern is employed to encapsulate cryptographic operations into distinct objects, allowing users to parameterize clients with various requests. This results in greater flexibility and ease of use when executing complex cryptographic commands.
- **Strategy Pattern:**
Embracing the strategy pattern, the Cryptographer project enables users to select from various encryption / decryption / hacking  strategies dynamically. This promotes adaptability and allows for the incorporation of new strategies without modifying existing code.
